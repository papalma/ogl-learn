# ogl-learn

## What is this?
This code comes from the book published on https://learnopengl.com. I want to learn OpenGL,
and practice git commands, so I thought is would be a good way to acomplish both objectives.

## Running
This has been tested on MacOS.
This includes a version of GLFW compiled for mac (no windows at this moment), which is required
to run the examples, if you want to try it on other platform, you should compile GLFW and update
the corresponding Makefile accordingly.
